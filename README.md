# UnityModLoader
This tool allows you to load mods into unity games

# Install

* Move UnityModLoader.Injection.dll and UnityModLoader.Library.dll to the game folder
* Launch the game
* Inject the UnityModLoader.Injection.dll file (I will create an injector soon)

# Add Mods

* Just move the mod files into the "Mods" folder
